# Bark Beetles: Predicting the Plague

**Author**

## Introduction
Europe's forests are dying at an unprecedented pace.

Over the last few years, recurring draught periods have weakened the natural defence systems of coniferous trees like spruces, pines and larches and contributed to the rapid reproduction of bark beetles. As a direct result, large parts of European forests have vanished since 2018. Epicentre of the German bark beetle epidemic is the Free State of Saxony, which is currently facing the greatest forest dieback since the beginning of kept forestry records. In this region alone, 86 million cubic metres of damaged wood were reported over the last three years. Half of this amount is directly attributed to the spruce bark beetle by itself.

## Objective
This project, made in collaboration with "Staatsbetrieb Sachsenforst", aims to support the fight against the spruce bark beetle by predicting the amount of infested wood in short-time intervals for locally distinct spatial administrative units in Saxony. This approach differs from previous approaches where predictions were made for larger areas and greater periods. Such meticulous predictions, powered by machine learning algorithms, would facilitate the targeted use of *Sachsenforst*'s resources by predicting potential infestation hotspots in the region.

The dataset will first need to be constructed from four different data sources. Additionally, an Exploratory Data Analysis, in which beetle phenology is compared to the actual relationships shown in the data, is also part of this project. Model deployment takes place in such a way, that *Sachsenforst* can use the insights gained, to predict the amount of infested wood for arbitrary timeframes and all 106 forestry districts and forest ownership groups.
